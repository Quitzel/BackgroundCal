The purpose of this program is to create a simple and easy to read calendar that is updated regularly on the desktop of a computer without causing undue strain on the system's hardware.  I plan to regularly update this program with new features as a way of expanding my knowledge and abilities when it comes to software development.  It has proved so far to be a fun program to work with and has been rather useful to me even in the early stages.  

Right now, this program is not ready for end users.  It is intended to be a tool on which I can build and has not been finished or polished at all yet.  Moving forward, it may reach such a point but as of right now it is not there.  

Anyone looking to collaborate with me on this can feel free to leave a comment on this repository or to create a copy of the code for their own use.
